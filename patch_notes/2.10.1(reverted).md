Version name: War

## What changed
- **TUNE.retaliateChaseRange = 6** — agents within 6 tiles (Manhattan) who were targeting the same crop will **chase** the harvester.
- **Immediate retaliation:** if a non-ally is within **attack range (≤2)** at the moment of harvest, they immediately start an `"attack"` action.
- **Chasing:** if out of attack range but within `retaliateChaseRange`, they:
  - set `other._chaseTargetId = harvester.id`
  - `planPathTo(..., { force: true })` toward the harvester's current cell
  - produce an `"info"` log entry.
- **Ongoing chase maintenance:** during ticks, chasers keep re-planning toward the moving target (respecting path budget/whitelist on subsequent replans), stop chasing if:
  - target disappears,
  - becomes same faction,
  - energy falls below `TUNE.energyLowThreshold`,
  - target moves beyond `retaliateChaseRange + 2`.
- **planPathTo()** now accepts an optional `opts` argument:
  - `planPathTo(world, a, gx, gy, { force: true })` bypasses the whitelist & budget once (for immediate, event-driven reactions). All existing calls without `opts` are unaffected.
- **Save/Load:** agents now serialize/restore `chaseTargetId` (internal `_chaseTargetId`). Old saves load fine (field is optional).

## Notes on gameplay & performance
- Forced pathing is **only** used on the first chase trigger, which keeps the sim responsive without flooding A*.
- Subsequent chase updates respect your tick-based **path budget & whitelist** so normal fairness/perf properties are preserved.
- Retaliation is energy-aware; starving agents won't pick fights.
